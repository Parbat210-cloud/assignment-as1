            <h2>Portfolio Development Report</h2>

            <section class="report-section">
                <h3>Development Experience</h3>
                <p>My journey into web development began with this module and the creation of this portfolio
                    website. What started as an intimidating challenge quickly evolved into an engaging learning
                    experience that taught me the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and responsive design.</p>

                <p>The learning curve was steep at first. I struggled with understanding how to structure HTML
                    documents properly and how the CSS box model worked. The biggest challenge was grasping the
                    concept of responsive design - making sure my website looked good on all devices. After numerous
                    hours of practice and research, I began to understand the importance of semantic HTML tags and
                    how to use media queries effectively.</p>

                <p>One particular breakthrough moment was when I finally understood how flexbox and grid layouts
                    work. This dramatically improved my ability to create complex layouts without relying on
                    outdated techniques like floating elements. The projects page of this portfolio demonstrates my
                    understanding of grid layouts, while other pages utilize flexbox for more straightforward
                    content arrangements.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="report-section">
                <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                <p>For the design of this portfolio, I wanted to create something clean, modern, and professional. I
                    was inspired by minimalist design principles that focus on content readability and user
                    experience. The color scheme consists of a dark blue primary color with light accents to create
                    contrast and visual hierarchy.</p>

                <p>I chose the font combination of 'Montserrat' for headings and 'Open Sans' for body text because
                    they offer excellent readability while still looking modern and professional. The spacing
                    between elements was carefully considered to create a balanced layout that guides the user's eye
                    through the content.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="report-section">
                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>The website is built using semantic HTML5 elements throughout, including appropriate use of
                    header, nav, main, section, article, and footer tags. This approach improves accessibility and
                    search engine optimization.</p>

                <p>For the CSS implementation, I focused on creating a mobile-first design that scales up to larger
                    screens using media queries. I implemented custom variables (CSS custom properties) to maintain
                    consistency in colors and spacing throughout the site.</p>

                <p>The responsive navigation menu transforms into a hamburger menu on mobile devices using only CSS,
                    without the need for JavaScript. This ensures that navigation remains accessible regardless of
                    screen size.</p>

                <p>The projects page uses CSS Grid to create a dynamic layout that adjusts based on screen size,
                    while the contact page implements flexbox to create a two-column layout on larger screens that
                    stacks vertically on mobile devices.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="report-section">
                <h3>Challenges and Learning</h3>
                <p>Throughout this development process, I faced several challenges. The most significant was
                    implementing responsive design that worked consistently across different browsers and devices. I
                    spent considerable time testing and refining my media queries to ensure a smooth experience.</p>

                <p>Another challenge was creating the contact form that launches the user's email program. I had to
                    research the correct attributes for the form element and understand how the mailto protocol
                    works.</p>

                <p>This project taught me the importance of planning before coding. Initial sketches and wireframes
                    saved me countless hours of rework and helped me maintain a consistent design throughout the
                    site.</p>

                <p>In future projects, I plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques like animations and
                    transitions to create more engaging user experiences. I also want to learn JavaScript frameworks
                    to add more interactive elements to my projects.</p>
